# Deep Learning for Image Classification: A ResNet-Based Approach

## Project Overview
This repository contains a deep learning mini-project focused on image classification using the ResNet architecture. It includes Python scripts for creating datasets, training and validating models, and testing their performance, alongside a comprehensive Jupyter notebook detailing the entire process.

## Getting Started
- Clone the repository to your local machine.
- Ensure Python is installed and set up the required environment. (A `requirements.txt` file could be added here for ease of setup.)
- Run `create_dataset.py` to prepare your dataset.
- Use `train_validate.py` for training and validating the model, and `test.py` for evaluating its performance on unseen data.
- The `train_validate_test.ipynb` notebook offers an interactive walkthrough of the processes involved.

## Features
- Dataset creation and preprocessing.
- Training and validation of a ResNet model for image classification.
- Testing and performance evaluation.
- Utility functions to support model training and evaluation.

## Contributions
Contributions to this project are welcome. Feel free to fork the repo, make improvements, and submit a pull request.
